# ❤️ Heart Disease Detection using ANN  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts the presence of heart disease in a patient using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model based on various health parameters. The model is trained on the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**.  

---

## 📊 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For building the ANN)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Data preprocessing, model evaluation)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (For data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (For data visualization)  
- **Flask (Optional)** (For web-based deployment)  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of **303 patient records** with **14 features**, including:  
- **Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression, and more.**  
- **Target Variable:** 0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease Present
